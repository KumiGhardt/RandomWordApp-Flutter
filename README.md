# flutter_application_1

My first Flutter project

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

````
In this app, I follow instructions and:

Create a Flutter app from the ground up.
Write Dart code.
Leverage an external, third-party library(pub.dev).
Use hot reload for a faster development cycle.
Implement a stateful widget.
Create a lazily loaded, infinite scrolling list.
